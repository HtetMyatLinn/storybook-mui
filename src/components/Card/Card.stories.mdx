# Card Component

Cards contain content and actions about a single subject.
Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic.
They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Card">{CardComponent.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>
