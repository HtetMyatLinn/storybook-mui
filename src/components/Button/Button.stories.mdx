# Button Component

Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

- Modal windows
- Forms
- Cards
- Toolbars

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Button">{ButtonComponent.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>
